# Smart Queuing System - IoT Edge AI Application

### Overview

The Smart Queuing System will demostrate how to  create a smart video IoT solution using IntelÂ® hardware and software tools. This Edge app will detect the number of people in different queues and will help in reducing the congestion in the queuing system in real time.

The project presents following 3 real world scenarios where we can potentially deploy this smart queuing system :
1. Manufacturing Sector
2. Retail Sector
3. Transportation Sector

### Main Tasks 

1. Propose a possible hardware solution
2. Build out your application and test its performance on the DevCloud using multiple hardware types
3. Compare the performance to see which hardware performed best
4. Revise your proposal based on the test results

### Goal 

Building Edge App to reduce congestion in the queuing system.
